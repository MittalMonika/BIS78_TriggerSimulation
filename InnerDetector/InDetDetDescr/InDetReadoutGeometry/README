Package:      offline/InnerDetector/InDetDetDescr/InDetReadoutGeometry  

Originial author:  Grant Gorfine, left particle physics
Responsible:       Xiaocong Ai <xiaocong.ai@desy.de>

Description:  Detector description manager and readout elements base classes.
              Used by Pixel, SCT/Strips and TRT.

History: Original written by Grant Gorfine, bringing together many elements that pre-date Athena. 
         This package handled the detector managers and readout geometry of all inner detector components. 
         Split into four packages by Xiaocong Ai, March 2018: InDetReadoutGeometry as the basic package, and 
         PixelReadoutGeometry, SCT_ReadoutGeometry, and TRT_ReadoutGeometry packages which use InDetReadoutGeometry.

         Next: goal is to simplify the identifier schemes, reference frames, transformations, and generally simplify 
         InDetReadoutGeometry and Pixel, SCT_ and TRT_ReadoutGeometry packages. Planned changes are in 
         https://gitlab.cern.ch/nstyles/ReadoutGeometryDocumentation

         This is a major change and will be disruptive, but hopefully worth it in the long run.
