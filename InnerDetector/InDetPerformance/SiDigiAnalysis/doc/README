Simple analysis of G4 Silicon Digitization output.

Derived from SiHitAnal and Jason's SiHitMapper

Prepare a digits file with athena jobOptions_digitazation_SLHC.py which writes the results of digitization into a  root file.

Run athena with jobOptions_SiDigAnal to read this file in.

This writes out a new root tree, simpler to analyse.

Analyse this by running root:
$ root
root> .x stripDig.C

...produces a bunch of histograms in pdf files summarising digitization results.
