If I create a file named

/afs/cern.ch/atlas/tzero/run/run2cafTOM/msgbox/idalignTOM.msg

with just :

spp tom idalignreco00 inputdsspecautomatic  "(type='RAW' AND project LIKE 'data16_%eV' AND streamtype='calibration' AND stream='IDTracks' AND datasetname LIKE '%.merge.RAW' AND totevents>10000 AND runnr<=302300)"

the process of future runs will be stopped.


To restart them again when desired, I will need to put the following one:

spp tom idalignreco00 inputdsspecautomatic  "(type='RAW' AND project LIKE 'data16_%eV' AND streamtype='calibration' AND stream='IDTracks' AND datasetname LIKE '%.merge.RAW' AND totevents>10000 AND runnr>288000)"
