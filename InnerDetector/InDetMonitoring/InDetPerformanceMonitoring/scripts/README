Produce maps using batch
=========================

Setup an athena release, such that you have a $TestArea
Checkout the InDetPerformanceMonitoring package
$> cmt co InnerDetector/InDetMonitoring/InDetPerformanceMonitoring

Checkout patch which is located here:
$> cp $TestArea
Use this patch:
$> cp /afs/cern.ch/work/s/sthenkel/public/forPF/Reconstruction .




Copy the NEW alignment constants in this directory:
/afs/cern.ch/work/s/sthenkel/public/forPF/ScriptsToRunWeakModeMaps/runOnBatch/AlignmentConstants/
or define own global pass and hange the inputConstants variable in runzmumu_runallmonitoring.py to the NEW alignment constants.

Run jobs on the batch using:
$> python athenaJob_Batch.py Run_StableInPeriodE.txt

The output needs to be merged


You can run the maps with
$> root -l
-- .L run_ZmumuValidation.C++
-- run_ZmumuValidation(20,0,2)

That results in a rootfile

Change the f_file variable in printCorrectionMaps_simple.py to the outputted rootfile. Then execute:

$> python printCorrectionMaps_simple.py
that results in a pdf containing all four maps in the directory outputmaps
