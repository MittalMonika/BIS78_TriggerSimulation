	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-02-03
	* Added example macro to evaluate Higgs theory uncertainties
	* All results produced so far makes sense! (mostly)
	* Central values, PDF uncertainties, alphaS. Didn't check QCD yet..

	* All PDF weighs now read in to HiggsWeight struct, both to
	*  1. reweight to a differnet PDF (central value) and
	*  2. assess uncertainty using the error sets of PDF4LHC and NNPDF3.0
	* Test exectuable now
	* 1. accesses proper STXS obserables if existing in input file
	* 2. produce histograms in output files (Higgs pT, yH, Njets, STXS spectra)

	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-02-01
	* Support for forcing expected structure for Run-2 default VBF and VH sampels (W+H, W-H, ZH)
	* Better error handling (code did not abort as intended when something was wrong)

	* First version of HiggsWeightTool as announced on today's HComb meeeting: https://indico.cern.ch/event/616388/
	* Improvements for Athena users by Will Buttinger (Thanks!):
	  Even if the input file doesn't have the TruthMetaData, the tool will access the athena-only IOVMetaData
	* Note: this is still a beta-version, no full validation done yet (although output values look reasonable)

	* Test exe that works in athena - but only in classAccess mode since TruthMetaData POOL converter missing
	* AsgMetaDataTool need to call sysInitialze rather than initialize to be registred in tool svc
	* Many thanks to Will Buttinger for help

2017-02-24 Dag Gillberg <dag.gillberg@cern.ch>
	* Adding a few more user friendly methods to the TruthWeightTool

	* Moving Tobias Bisanz' TruthWeightTool from Generators/GenAnalysisTools/TruthTools to this package (PhysicsAnalysis/TruthWeightTools) since its intended for physics analysis
