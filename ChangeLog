	* Tagging TruthWeightTools-01-02-01
	* Support for forcing expected structure for Run-2 default VBF and VH sampels (W+H, W-H, ZH)
	* Better error handling (code did not abort as intended when something was wrong)

	* First version of HiggsWeightTool as announced on today's HComb meeeting: https://indico.cern.ch/event/616388/
	* Improvements for Athena users by Will Buttinger (Thanks!):
	  Even if the input file doesn't have the TruthMetaData, the tool will access the athena-only IOVMetaData
	* Note: this is still a beta-version, no full validation done yet (although output values look reasonable)

	* Test exe that works in athena - but only in classAccess mode since TruthMetaData POOL converter missing
	* AsgMetaDataTool need to call sysInitialze rather than initialize to be registred in tool svc
	* Many thanks to Will Buttinger for help
