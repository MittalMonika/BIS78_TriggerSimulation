A Message to Developers
-----------------------
 



* Your Athena-based algorithms MUST inherit from
TauDiscriToolBase and implement the interface there.

* If you want your id method to be useable by
TauIDReader on ROOT ntuples, your underlying id
class MUST inherit from MethodBase (and implement
the interface) and MUST NOT depend on Athena-based headers.
