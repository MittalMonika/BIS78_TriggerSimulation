Root to HDF5 Tree Converter
===========================

Run `bin/ttree2hdf5` to convert your root tree to an HDF5 file.

Branches that contain basic types (one value per entry in the tree)
are stored as a 1D array of compound data type. Branches that store
`vector<T>` are stored in a 2D array, while branches of type
`vector<vector<T> >` are stored in a 3D array. If you want more
dimensions feel free to [file an issue][1].

Note that **we only support the types listed above**. The purpose of
this package is _not_ to provide a generic converter from ROOT to
HDF5, but rather to convert simple ROOT files to a more widely
supported data format.

Output Format
-------------

You can specify the maximum dimensions of the HDF5 array with

```
ttree2hdf5 <root-file> -o <output-file> -l [dims..]
```

where the `[dims..]` argument can have up to two integers.

You can also filter branches with the `--branch-regex` option.

For more options check `ttree2hdf5 -h`.

Setup
=====

The dependencies are HDF5 (C++ interfaces required), boost (for
`program_options`) and ROOT. If these are available on your system you
can build with `make`.

Building with CMake
-------------------

We also include a CMake file. Run

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j 4
```

If you don't have access to HDF5, you can tell CMake to build it by
replacing the `cmake ..` line with

```
cmake -DBUILTIN_HDF5=TRUE ..
```

Note that this takes about 10 minutes. If you already have HDF5 built
somewhere, you can also add the executables to your path: cmake should
find them.

Building in Special Environments
--------------------------------

Here **we count LHC experiments like ATLAS as "special"**: you
typically need to figure out how to find everything on
`/cvmfs/`. There are scripts to setup these environments in `setup/`,
e.g.:

```
source setup/atlas-cvmfs.sh
```

Since we don't currently have HDF5 working in LCG (see this
[JIRA issue][1]) I've built a version on AFS which should be
compatible with the above setup script. Run

```
HDF5_ROOT=${HDF5_ROOT} cmake ..
```

And be sure to complain to LCG so they fix their HDF5 installation.

Hacking This Code
=================

I've _tried_ to make this code as modular and straightforward as
possible. Of course if anything is unclear you should
[file an issue][1].

The main algorithm `ttree2hdf5` is a thin wrapper on
`copy_root_tree`. Reading the code in `src/copy_root_tree.cxx` should
be a decent introduction to the higher level classes you'll need to
interact with.

As for compiling: anything in `src/` which starts with `ttree2hdf*`
will compile into an executable by default, whereas anything in `src/`
will compile and link to the executables by default.

To Do
-----

Other things I might do sometime:

 - Allow grouping of different branches into different output datasets
 - Give the option to supply a TCut string to skim the ntuple
 - Merge with the other [root to hdf5 converter][2] I made for histograms.

If you want these things, or anything else, [file an issue][1].
