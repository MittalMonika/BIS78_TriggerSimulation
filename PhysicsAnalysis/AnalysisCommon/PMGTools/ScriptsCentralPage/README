These are the PMG Central Page scripts 

Everything is generated by a chronjob that runs every X hours (CronjobMakeTables.sh)

In order for this to work, you need to setup a long term proxy:
myproxy-init -d -s myproxy.cern.ch -c 744 --voms atlas
The matching password needs to be stored in /afs/cern.ch/user/m/mcgensvc/delegation.pwd
