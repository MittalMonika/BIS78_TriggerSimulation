Recipe to run PhotonAnalysisUtils on release 15.6.1
===================================================

- From tag 00-00-73 on, PAU is able to run on real data. 

- The main PAU jobOptions structure has been cleaned and
  parameterized, so that you don't need anymore to copy it in you
  running area, and can just set the main options via a very short
  topOtions. See details below.

A) INSTALLATION

**NOTICE** 
unless you work on nightlies, check out and build PhysicsAnalysis/MCTruthClassifier package
*******************************************************************************************

- Configure athena for release 15.6.1 (for older releases look inside
  the share/archive/ subdirectory)
	
	cd cmthome_15.6.1
	source setup.sh -tag=15.6.1

   You do not need to check out other package.
  (But for some data, you will need MagneticField/BFieldData-01-06-08)

- Check out PhotonAnalysisUtils and compile:
	
  + using the HEAD:
	
	cmt co PhysicsAnalysis/StandardModelPhys/PhotonAnalysisUtils

  + or using the specific version XY-ZT-UV:
	
	cmt co -r PhotonAnalysisUtils-XY-ZT-UV PhysicsAnalysis/StandardModelPhys/PhotonAnalysisUtils
	cd PhysicsAnalysis/StandardModelPhys/PhotonAnalysisUtils/cmt
	make
	cd -

B) EXECUTION

- Setup a (minimal) run directory:

	cd PhysicsAnalysis/StandardModelPhys/PhotonAnalysisUtils/run
	
	cp ../share/PT2dist.root .
	cp ../share/topOptions_PAU.py .

  Since PhotonAnalysisUtils-00-00-82 you will just need the 2 files
  above to run a PAU instance. You can have as many
  topOptions_PAU.py files you like, each one will contain the
  steering options that will be passed to the main PAU jobOptions
  sitting in your InstallArea. Have a look to
  topOptions_PAU.py for details.

- For Data : you can use selection of good LumiBlock based on GRL xml file.
  You need a MyLBCollection.xml file in your run directory. The flag is not actived by default.
  [the switch UseGRLSelection PAU will process only events in good lumi block.]
  The xml file has to be updated to include new runs

  You may need to checkout the packages here
  https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/Atlas/GoodRunsLists#2009_10_17_Recommended_release_a

edit topOptions_PAU.py :
-put your favorite file and the geometry
-choose the type of dataset : data or MC
-in case of data, activate or no the LumiBlock selection. If activated, provide the file .xml

- Run in interactive mode :

	athena.py topOptions_PAU.py

- Run on the grid using PANDA: 

	pathena --extFile PT2dist.root \
                --inDS <YourInputDataSet> \ 
                --outDS <YourOutputDataset> \
                --extFile <YourFile.xml> \  # this line should be considered only if you run the data with the .xml
	        --extOutFile PAUReco.root \ # Leave as in default or change to the 'OutpuFile' you defined in topOptions_PAU.py
	        --nFilesPerJob 4 \ #if you work with huge dataset (for example dijets), use 1 here
                --tmpDir /tmp/<YourUserName> \
		--site=<YourSite> \ #if you wish the site to be chosen automaticaly, skip this line
                topOptions_PAU.py
