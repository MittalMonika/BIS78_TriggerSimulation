Recipe to run PhotonAnalysisUtils on release 15.6.8.4,AtlasProduction
===================================================

A) INSTALLATION

- Configure athena for release 15.6.8.4,AtlasProduction (for older releases look inside
  the share/archive/ subdirectory)
	
	cd cmthome_15.6.8.4
	source setup.sh -tag=15.6.8.4,AtlasProduction

- Check out PhotonAnalysisUtils from HEAD and compile:
	
	cmt co PhysicsAnalysis/StandardModelPhys/PhotonAnalysisUtils

/*NOTE*/
- For MC: one needs to check out the package PhysicsAnalysis/MCTruthClassifier-00-00-07
to prevent a rare crash.

B) EXECUTION

- Setup a (minimal) run directory: from your local test area (i.e. were you 
  checked out PAU...) 

	mkdir run
	cd run
	cp ../InstallArea/jobOptions/PhotonAnalysisUtils/topOptions_PAU.py .

  You can make as many topOptions_PAU.py files you like, each one customized to
  contain the steering options that will be passed to the main PAU jobOptions
  sitting in your InstallArea. Have a look to topOptions_PAU.py for details.

- For Data : you can use selection of good LumiBlock based on GRL xml file.
  You need a MyLBCollection.xml file in your run directory. The flag is not actived by default.
  [the switch UseGRLSelection PAU will process only events in good lumi block.]
  The xml file has to be updated to include new runs

  You may need to checkout the packages here
  https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/viewauth/Atlas/GoodRunsLists#2009_10_17_Recommended_release_a

edit topOptions_PAU.py :
-put your favorite file and the geometry : Geometry is no more to specify : experimental test
-choose the type of dataset : data or MC
-in case of data, activate or no the LumiBlock selection. If activated, provide the file .xml

- Run in interactive mode :

	athena.py topOptions_PAU.py

- Run on the grid using PANDA: 

	pathena --extFile PT2dist.root \
                --inDS <YourInputDataSet> \ 
                --outDS <YourOutputDataset> \   #use option --official if you wish to have right to have an output without your Name
                --extFile <YourFile.xml> \  # this line should be considered only if you run the data with the .xml
	        --extOutFile PAUReco.root \ # Leave as in default or change to the 'OutpuFile' you defined in topOptions_PAU.py
	        --nFilesPerJob 4 \ #if you work with huge dataset (for example dijets), use 1 here
                --tmpDir /tmp/<YourUserName> \
		--site=<YourSite> \ #if you wish the site to be chosen automaticaly, skip this line
                topOptions_PAU.py

 - Note: When running on the grid using pathena, topOptions_PAU.py must define an input file that is valid for local running.
   This can be almost any file that you might use to test PAU on your local PC - it does not necessarily need to be from the
   same dataset as defined in "--inDS".  pathena does a quick test of the jobOptions before submission, which includes
   checking various configuration parameters against an input POOL file.  Without a local file to test against, the
   pathena submission will fail.
