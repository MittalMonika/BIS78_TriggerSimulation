AthenaPool is a toolkit to support use of LCG POOL as a persistence technology in Athena.
It consists of several packages:  PoolSvc, AthenaPoolCnvSvc, AthenaPoolUtilities,
%DBDataModel(this one), DBDataModelAthenaPool, EventSelectorAthenaPool, and OutputStreamAthenaPool.

The DBDataModel package contains the definition of the persistent Data Model classes such as
DataHeader and DataHeaderElement.

@subsection DataHeader

The DataHeader class contains a status flag, a processing tag string and two vectors of
DataHeaderElements.
Each DataHeaderElement stores the ClassID (and a set of symlinked ClassIDs), Key (plus a set of
StoreGate aliases) and Token string of a DataObject.
One vector stores DataHeaderElements for all persistified data objects (called the "DataObject" vector)
and the other one stores the same information for all upstream DataHeader ("Provenance" vector).
A DataHeader is written automatically by AthenaPOOL for each "event". It is used to load the persistified
DataObject from POOL and provide support for BackNavigation.
