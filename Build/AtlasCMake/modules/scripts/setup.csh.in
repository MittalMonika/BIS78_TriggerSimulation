# Script providing a functional runtime environment for project
# @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@ when sourced from TCSH.
#

# Make sure that we run in (T)CSH:
set sourced=($_)
if ( "$sourced" == "" ) then
    echo "ERROR: This script must be sourced from TCSH"
    return 1
endif

# Get the name of the directory of the script:
set thisdir=`dirname $sourced[2]`
unset sourced

# Decide about the environment status variable to be used:
set ENV_VAR=@CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_SET_UP

    set ENV_VAR=@CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_EXTONLY_SET_UP
else if ( "$*" == "relonly" ) then
    set ENV_VAR=@CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_RELONLY_SET_UP
endif

# Prevent the script from being called multiple times:
if ( ! `eval echo \$\?$ENV_VAR` ) then

    # Set the variable now:
    eval "setenv $ENV_VAR 1"

    # Set up the project's main directory:
    setenv @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_DIR `cd $thisdir && pwd`
    unset thisdir

    # Extract directory names relevant for the rest of the operations:
    setenv @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_PLATFORM `basename $@CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_DIR`
    set helper1=`dirname $@CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_DIR`
    set helper2=`dirname $helper1`
    setenv @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_VERSION `basename $helper2`
    unset helper1 helper2

    # Base project(s) used for the build of @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@:
    set @CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME@_BASEPROJECTS="@ATLAS_BASE_PROJECT_NAMES@"

# Clean up:
