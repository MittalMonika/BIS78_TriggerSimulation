This JO can be used to generate events using Generate_trf:

  Generate_trf.py ecmEnergy=8000 runNumber=999999 firstEvent=1 randomSeed=1 jobConfig=MC12.999999.Sherpa_Example.py outputEVNTFile=/tmp/pool.root

It will take a few minutes to initialise the generator,
e.g. performing the phase space integrations over the
Z+0 and Z+1 jet process. The initialisation results will
be written out to two directories, Process/ and Results/.

To avoid the initialisation step for multiple evgen runs
it is advisable to create a tarball containing the Process/
and Results/ directories and pass that on to Generate_trf
as an argument:

  Generate_trf.py ecmEnergy=8000 runNumber=999999 firstEvent=1 randomSeed=1 jobConfig=MC12.999999.Sherpa_Example.py outputEVNTFile=/tmp/pool.root inputGenConfFile=input.tar.gz

This is also possible for central production, in which
case not only the JO has to be provided to the MC production
team but also that tarball.
