This is the Geant4 pseudopackage for the real external Geant4 package. 
Its purpose is to allow simulation developers to work in the ATLAS 
cvs/srt environment.

This package is enabled only on Linux and Solaris, the reason being that 
Geant4 use native STL on Linux and ObjectSpace everywhere else, whereas 
ATLAS offline use native STL everywhere except for Solaris. 

The default implementation assumes that the Geant4 installation directory 
is at CERN under /afs/cern.ch/atlas/offline/external/geant4 and sets
G4INSTALL=/afs/cern.ch/atlas/offline/external/geant4/geant4.1.0.

This can be overriden by the user, who can run `make G4INSTALL=foo', 
foo being his local institute installation for example.

All Geant4 include paths (G4FLAGS) as well as the flags necessary for Geant4 
visualisation (G4VISFLAGS) with DAWN (G4DAWNFLAGS), some general user 
interface flags (G4UIFLAGS) and the Geant4 persistency flags (G4ODBMSFLAGS) 
are available. Other visualisation and user interface options/flags will 
also become available. For details please browse the Geant4.mk.in file 
in this directory.
The necessary libraries are linked using the dependencies found recursively 
under the user $(top_srcdir)/.srt/$(SRT_TARGET) directory.

Examples on how to use the Geant4 pseudopackage are available under the 
offline/Simulation/G4AtlasExamples package.
