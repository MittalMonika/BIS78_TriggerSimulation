/*
 * @brief Property holding a SG store/key/clid/attr name from which a
 *        ReadDecorHandle is made.
 *
 * This class holds the key part of a ReadDecorHandle.
 *
 * Use this to read a decoration on an object such that the scheduler
 * is aware of it.  This is used just like a @c ReadHandleKey (which see)
 * except that the key string is of the form CCC.DDD, where CCC is the
 * name of the container in StoreGate and DDD is the name of the decoration.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *@code
 *  class MyAlgorithm : public AthReentrantAlgorithm {
 *    ...
 *    SG::ReadDecorHandleKey<MyCont> m_key;
 *  };
 *  ...
 *  MyAlgorithm::MyAlgorithm (const std::string& name, ISvcLocator* svcloc)
 *    : AthReentrantAlgorithm (name, svcloc), ...
 *  {
 *    declareProperty ("Key", m_key = "container.decor");
 *    ...
 *  }
 *
 *  StatusCode MyAlgorithm::initialize()
 *  {
 *    ATH_CHECK( m_key.initialize() );
 *    ...
 *  }
 *
 *  StatusCode MyAlgorithm::execute (const EventContext& ctx) const
 *  {
 *    SG::ReadDecorHandle<MyCont, float> h (m_key, ctx);
 *    for (const MyObj& o : *h) {  // Access the container.
 *      doSomething (h (o));  // Access the decoration.
 *      ...
 @endcode
 *
 * One can run into issues with the scheduler if this is used in conjunction
 * with inheritance.  For example, if @c D derives from @c B, and one uses
 * WriteDecorHandleKey<B>, then the scheduler will know only about the
 * B.DECOR output; it won't have a dependency for D.DECOR.  That means that
 * trying to use D.DECOR as a dependency downstream won't work.  To solve this,
 * we arrange that the CLID in the DataObjID for ReadDecorHandleKey<D>
 * is actually that for B; in that case, the scheduler will be happy.
