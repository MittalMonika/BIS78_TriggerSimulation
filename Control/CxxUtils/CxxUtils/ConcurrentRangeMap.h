/**
 * @brief Map from range to payload object, allowing concurrent, lockless reads.
 *
 * This class implements a map of sorted `range' objects (though only
 * a single value is actually used) to allocated payload objects.
 * Values can be looked up by a key; the value returned will be the
 * first for which the range is not less than the key.  We also
 * support insertions, erasures, and iteration.
 *
 * There can be only one writer at a time; this is enforced with internal locks.
 * However, there can be any number of concurrent readers at any time.
 * The reads are lockless (but not necessarily waitless, though this should
 * not be significant in practice).  So this is appropriate when
 * reads are much more frequent than writes.
 *
 * This implementation also assumes that a lookup is most likely to be
 * for the last element in the map, that insertions are most likely to be
 * at the end, and that erasures are most likely to be from the beginning.
 * This class will still work if these assumptions are violated, but it
 * may be much slower.  (The use case for which this was targeted
 * was that of conditions containers.)
 *
 * Template arguments:
 *  RANGE - The type of the range object stored with each element.
 *  KEY - The type used to look up objects in the container.  This may be
 *        same as RANGE, but not necessarily.  (For example, RANGE may
 *        contain start and end times, while KEY may be a single time.)
 *  COMPARE - Object used for key comparisons; see below.
 *  UPDATER - Object used for memory management; see below.
 *
 * COMPARE should implement a less-than relation, like a typical STL
 * comparison object, with these signatures:
 *
 *@code
 *  bool operator() (const KEY& k1,   const RANGE& r2) const;
 *  bool operator() (const RANGE& r1, const RANGE& r2) const;
 @endcode
 *
 * In order to implement updating concurrently with reading, we need to
 * defer deletion of objects until no thread can be referencing them any more.
 * The policy for this is set by the template UPDATER<T>.  An object
 * of this type owns an object of type T.  It should provide a typedef
 * Context_t, giving a type for an event context, identifying which
 * thread/slot is currently executing.  It should implement these operations:
 *
 *   - const T& get() const
 *     Return the current object.
 *   - void update (std::unique_ptr<T> p, const Context_t ctx);
 *     Atomically update the current object to be p.
 *     Deletion of the previous version should be deferred until
 *     no thread can be referencing it.
 *   - void quiescent (const Context_t& ctx);
 *     Declare that the thread described by ctx is no longer accessing
 *     the object.
 *   - static const Context_t& defaultContext();
 *     Return a context object for the currently-executing thread.
 *
 * For an example, see AthenaKernel/RCUUpdater.h.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *   The values we store are pairs of RANGE, const T*.
 *   The data are stored in a vector of such values.
 *   We maintain atomic pointers to the first and last valid elements
 *   in the map.  We can quickly add an element to the end or delete
 *   an element from the beginning by adjusting these pointers.
 *   Any other changes will require making a new copy of the data vector.
