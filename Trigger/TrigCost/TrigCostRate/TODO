* Add RunModule option to select files and events within a selected lumi block range

* Compute/predict rates by bunch group: physics, unpaired, empty, etc

* Read luminosity and DQ from COOL for range of lumi blocks

* Fix algorithm type id: same algorithm class are used at L2 and EF

* Fix problem with counting number of online events per application id and lumi block
  - make plot for L2 and EF farms occupancy and fraction of available CPU time
  - requires HLT counts in COOL

* Merging of L2 and EF streams

* TrigMonitoringEvent package:
  - instantiate all templates within TrigMonitoringEvent library
  - add get method for express PS
  - add rerurn PS value
  - allow update of groups and streams
  - Better L1 configuration information?

* TrigCostMonitor
  - add ROI information for creating new thresholds
  - add TE hypo variables

* Fix EF rates for chains which share L2 seed

* Rates for HLT trigger rejection at each signature step

* Add total integrated luminosity to xml file with rate results

* Add algorithm for processing ROB request time per detector and sub-detector 
  - TrigTimeRob, similar to TrigTimeAlg


Done:

> Load two sets of PS keys and compute weight ratios and rates

> Python module for pre and post processing of rates jobs

> Fix problem with stream group html page?

> Read full trigger configuration by run, lumi or keys
