# Simulation Tests  

## Reconstruction transform  
Runs the entire ATLAS conversion from ESD to AOD, turning on the L1calo simulation during this setup. 

## Standalone configuration  
Runs only the L1Calo simulation without other pieces of the ATLAS software. This is good for initial algorithm testing, 
running debugging or producing internal histograms one might not put into the reconstruction.
