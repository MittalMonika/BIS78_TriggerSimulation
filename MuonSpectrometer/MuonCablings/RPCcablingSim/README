This package contains the classes for handling the cabling configuration of 
the RPC barrel system. The cabling package can be run without any other service
loaded, but the RPCgeometrySvc is required if the RDO online <-> offline mapping
has to be used. Two sets of libraries are created: RPCcabling to be used into
ATHENA framework and RPCcab to be used for running a standalone application.


Basic Components:

CablingRPC       : singleton class handling the whole configuration of the RPC
                   cabling.

RPCcablingSvc    : interface class implementing the access to the RPCcabling
                   class as an ATHENA service.

CablingObject    : Implements the common funcionalities  of the cabling
                   configuration classes.

RDOindex         : maps the online indexes of a PAD into Sector Logic, ROD,
                   ROB indexes. It contains also a facility i for mapping the
                   PAD using the offline identifiers.

SectorLogicSetup : holds the configuration (chamber,wired or, coincidence 
                   matrices) of a sector logic type.

RPCchamber       : stores the cabling parameters for the RPC chamber and models 
                   the eta strip connections to the Coincidence Matrix. 

WiredOR          : models the phi strip connections from the RPCcahmaber (one 
                   side) up to the coincidence matix (other side).

CMAparameters    : contains the standard functionalities for storing and
                   retriving the configuration parameters of a coincidence 
                   matrix (cabling map, threshold registers, identifing 
                   indexes). 

EtaCMA           : provides a specialization of the basic CMAparameters class
                   implementing the cabling schema for the Eta view.

EvenPhiCMA       : provides a specialization of the basic CMAparameters class
                   implementing the cabling schema for the Phi view into the
                   right phi side of the trigger station.

OddPhiCMA        : provides a specialization of the basic CMAparameters class
                   implementing the cabling schema for the Phi view into the
                   left phi side of the trigger station.

CMAidentity      : stores the CMA identification indexes.

TRIGGERidentity  : implements the definitions for the RPC trigger types.

CMAprogram       : holds the configuration program for the Coincidence Matrix
                   (threshold registers, overlap bits, majority type etc.).

RPCchamberdata   : reads the RPCchamber sections into the ASCII database and
                   creates the related classes in memory.

WiredORdata      : reads the WiredOR sections into the ASCII database and 
                   creates the related classes in memory.

CMApivotdata     : reads the CMA pivot sections into the ASCII database and
                   creates the related classes in memory.

CMAcablingdata   : reads the CMA cabling section (for confirm planes) into the
                   ASCII database and creates the related clesses in memory.





Use and configuration in ATHENA:

    * Load and use the required DLL module with the following command lines:

       ApplicationMgr.DLLs += { "RPCcabling" };
       ApplicationMgr.ExtSvc += { "RPCcablingSvc" };

    * The configuration parameters put into the share directory (LVL1conf.data
      file and CMAprograms directory) must be accessible from the run directory.
      To run the CablingSvc make a link to those file.

    * Configuration parameters:

      ConfFileName     ["LVL1conf.data"]  file holding the Level-1 cabling data
