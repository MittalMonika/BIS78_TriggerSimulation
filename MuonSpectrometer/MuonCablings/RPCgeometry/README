This package contains the classes for handling the geometry of the RPC system.
The package requires the AMDB package for accessing the geometry data. Two sets
of libraries are created: TrigT1RPCgeometry to be used into ATHENA framework, 
and RPCgeometry to be used for running a standalone application.


Basic Components:

RPCGeometry    : singleton class handling the data structures which hold the 
                 geometric position of the RPC strips.

RPCgeoemtrySvc : interface class implementing the access to the RPCGeometry
                 class as an ATHENA service.

RPCdecoder     : class that handles the amdb <--> internal indexes conversion



Use and configuration in ATHENA:

    * Load and use the required DLL module with the following command lines:

       ApplicationMgr.DLLs += { "TrigT1RPCgeometry" , "AmdbsimrecAthena"};
       ApplicationMgr.ExtSvc += { "AmdbsimrecAthenaSvc", "RPCgeometrySvc" };

    * The geometry database amdb_simrec.data must be accessible from the run 
      directory.

    * Configuration parameters:

      DumpRPCGeometry  [false]  flag for dumping the whole geometry data
      DumpRPCStations  [false]  flag for dumping the RPC trigger stations
      Debug            [false]  flag for setting up the debugging
      DumpLVL1conf     [false]  flag for producing the Cabling file (RPC only)
      DumpFileName     ["LVL1conf.dump"]  file in which the dump is made
