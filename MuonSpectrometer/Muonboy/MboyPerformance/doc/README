MboyPerformance
================

Implementation by samira hassani (samira.hassani at cern.ch)

This package is for nightly testing of the muon spectrometer reconstruction programs Muonboy/Staco/MuTag  in the Run Time Tester (RTT) maintained at UCL.  Useful general info links:

UCL RTT Page - http://www.hep.ucl.ac.uk/atlas/AtlasTesting/

 It is divided into 2 parts:

1. Reconstruction scripts (currently run on digit files):

MboyPerformance_RTT.py- basic test
runs on digit file (single-track 10,100,500 GeV muons) 

Currently this file use RecExCommon to produce a AAN; and the new tracking is used if doStaco=True. 


2.use CBNTEvent.c

This reads in a generic Athena Aware Ntuple files and produces the efficiency, resolution, fakes,... 
between generated and reconstructed tracks.  All output (png,ps, dump) files are kept.  

Makefile (copied from InnerDetector/InDetValidation/InDetRTT/ExtraFiles/InDetRTT_Makefile) is compiled at runtime on the UCL RTT machines, and is called by the root script MboyPerformance.C.  
It includes these files:

 aantana.c
 AANTEvent.c
 AANTEvent.h
 Analysis.c
 Analysis.h
 Assoc.c
 Assoc.h
 cbntana.c
 CBNTEvent.c
 CBNTEvent.h
 Efficiency.c

 Fakes.c

 HasEvt.c

 Makefile
 Modele.c

 Staco.c

All are found in ExtraFiles.

As with all RTT scripts, the joboptions files and root script MboyPerformance.C are run
based on instructions given in test/MboyPerformance_TestConfiguration.xml
