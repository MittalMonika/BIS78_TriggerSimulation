contains makefile and src to build the hcg executable, for 
writing tamplate han config files from input root files ...

Usage: hcg [OPTIONS] input1.root ... inputN.root

    -o                FILENAME  	name of output (filename required)
    -b,   --base      DIR       	use directory DIR as the base for the han config
    -d,   --dir       DIR       	only directories below DIR where DIR is a structure such as HLT/TRIDT etc
    -x,   --exclude   DIR       	exclude directory DIR
    -s,   --slice     SLICE     	trigger signature name (for comments)
    -r,   --remap     SRC DST   	remap directory SRC to directory DST
    -a,   --algorithm VALUE     	use VALUE as the execution algorithm for each histogram
    -af,  --algfile   FILENAME  	read algorithm information from FILENAME
    -ds,  --desc      DESCRIP   	use DESCRIP as the description
    -df,  --descfile  FILENAME  	read descriptions from FILENAME
    -dp,  --dispfile  FILENAME  	read display information from FILENAME
    -t,   --tag       VALUE     	add the VALUE to the list of command per histogram
    -wc,  --wildcard            	print use hist * rather than a separate entry for each histogram
    -dr,  --deleteref           	delete unselected histograms
    -or,  --outref   FILENAME   	file to write reduced output to (overwrites input otherwise) 
    -rh,  --relocate            	relocate selected histograms
    -ref, --reference TAG FILE  	add FILE as a reference file with tag TAG
    -rc,  --refconf       FILE  	add FILE to the config as a reference block
    -v,   --verbose             	print verbose output
    -h,   --help                	display this help



for instance ...

 hcg  hid_shifter.root  -d HLT/TRIDT -x TestMon -o  hc.config

will take the directory structure in file eg

  hid_shifter.root

and generate a config from the directory structure hanging from 

  run_253124/HLT/TRIDT

generating the config using HLT (ie the first directory in HLT/TRIDT ) 
as the base directory, and excluding any directory with the name 
"TestMon"

To remap a name, eg suppose you have the directory SOME_STUFF in the file, 
but want this to correspond to a menu side bar item of NICE, then including 
options

 -r SOME_STUFF NICE

should do this. Any number of remappings of this sort should be possible...

 -r SOME_STUFF NICE  -r ANOTHER EVEN_NICER

The option 

   --deleteref

will delete the histograms that are not selected, so do check the 
provided configuration before using this option. It does save the
original file in FILEMAN.bak however for emergencies


There are options to be able to specify algorithms, and descriptions 
for specific histograms from a file. Using a c++ like format file 
with options such as 

SomeHistogram = SomeAlgorithm&GetherData ;

Comments starting with // are allowed.
The layout can be free formatted.

** NB: If a config output file in not given in the command line it writes **
**     the config to stdout, and all other documentation and debugging    **
**     information is written to stderr                                     **
