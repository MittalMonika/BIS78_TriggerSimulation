This Branch
-----------

This branch is `21.0-mc16a` which contains the code for the ATLAS
MC16a campaign.

This branch supports builds of the `Athena` project, as numbered
releases `21.0.20.Y` because the branch was made to ensure
consistency with the AtlasOffline 21.0.20 build, which was the starting
point for the MC16a campaign.
